# JerdApp
An Android mobile app for journalism students, professionals, and organizations to maintain and share sources.

Jerd allows journalists to take pictures, record audio, and jot down notes, and to choose to save them on their mobile devices and/or in the cloud. Collaborators can then download the material off the cloud using a password to transcribe or examine others' material.

This app was submitted for the 2016 Congressional App Challenge and was the CA-26th District winner.
